Feel free to use the dataset I used i.e. `sonar.csv`. Be sure to keep the notebook and csv file both in the same directory.
Cheers!

Before executing the python notebook be sure to install pandas, matplotlib and numpy. For installing first check if you have python installed. Head over to python.org to install python. When installed run command prompt. Execute the command `pip install keras`, `pip install matplotlib` and then `pip install numpy`. These codes will successfully install keras, matplotlib and numpy modules in your system.
